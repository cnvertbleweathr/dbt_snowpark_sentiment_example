1,Good but need updates and improvements
2,"Worst mobile i have bought ever, Battery is draining like hell, backup is only 6 to 7 hours with internet uses, even if I put mobile idle its getting discharged.This is biggest lie from Amazon & Lenove which is not at all expected, they are making full by saying that battery is 4000MAH & booster charger is fake, it takes at least 4 to 5 hours to be fully charged.Don't know how Lenovo will survive by making full of us.Please don;t go for this else you will regret like me."

76,Firstly product not delivered on time dissatisfied 2 weeks.Secondly Android 7.1.1 naugat doesn't have call recording optionThirdly when selling product cost was 13999/- now why drastically dropped. 10999/-Fourthly when talking over the phone feels like nerve pulling to much radiation need immediate fix on this matter as it's safety and security of customer.Fifthly if any issues in hardware issues please let us know the service centers location. And please ensure hardware availability should be there at any time when customers booked.Finally as discribed about product all features are ok no issues found as mentioned earlier if call recording option would have added the this product would have been met the expectations.Camera quality is good not bad snap attached.

86,The look and sleekness of this phone is good. But the features in this phone is very less as this phone doesn't have the basic features like no sound controler option in shortcut shutter and most importantly there is no voice call recorder and the camera quality is also not good it is average in performance.
87,"Third class phone, this Time Lenovo disappointed me, i have k3 and k4 note so bought k8 note without any kind of thinking and disappointed. It stucks anytime without any load to ram, battery is also Third class defuces in very short time and turbo charge works sometimes but most of the time it works as normal charger.Gallery and many othet apps aren't available as it has stock Android, best thing is it often shows that process.android.com stopped workingWhat the .."

95,"If you are looking for a mid range phone U can go for this, features are pretty good but some small problems arises now and then, if ignored then worth the money"
96,As sim slot was not working I returned and got fast delivery too so giving 5 star bcz I m lenovo fan and I just love mobile the best mobile of this year. It get hot in less time but I guess we ca. Ignore it bcz the phone is v.good and with lots of good features and killer look too.
97,Worst for gaming and music.. I bought this for the deca core processor it has but it works worse than a quad core processed phone. And it said it has 2 speakers but one of them (left) doesn't have a speaker just holes to cheat buyers. Decent camera and display. Battery could be made better. And the ram keeps on working for 50 - 60% even while the phone is not in use.
98,Really awsome
99,There is heating and battery backup problem
